**Name**: News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection

**Authors**: R. Misra, A. Prahal, J. Grover

# Description
The dataset contains around 28 thousand entries collected from newspaper article headlines of two websites [*TheOnion*](https://www.theonion.com/) and [*HuffPost*](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/). Each headline is further annotated with a binary class label describing whether it is sarcastic or not. The labelling corresponds to the source of the article headline, as *TheOnion* produces sarcastic headlines and *HuffPost* is a serious news publishing website.

# Preprocessing
Furthermore, this folder contains the output of the preprocessing applied to the raw data stored in the [dataset.conllu](dataset.conllu) file.
